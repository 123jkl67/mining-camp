Automated deployment of Minecraft servers on AWS spot instances.

Quick Guide
-----------

You'll need your AWS credentials available for most of these operations, under
the `minecraft` profile. `~/.aws/credentials` will look like:

```
[minecraft]
aws_access_key_id = <your_access_key_here>
aws_secret_access_key = <your_secret_key_here>
```

Check out this repository, and `cd` into it. Install the requirements (using a
virtual environment is highly recommended) using pip.

```
$ mkvirtualenv minecraft
(minecraft) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
